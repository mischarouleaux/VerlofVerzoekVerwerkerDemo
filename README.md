# VerlofVerzoekVerwerker

I made this application during my first internship period at KEMBIT. It's a tool which enables employees to ask permission for vacation. 

It's sounds easy, but to make it a little more challenging. We integrated the application with systems from the company itself.

The problem at KEMBIT was that there wasn't a single way to request vacation. You could do it through a mail, or just ask the manager. There was absolutely no overview. So what did I do, yeah you guest it. I made an application where there is only one single way to ask for vacation. I made a centralized overview.

It has a single sign on portal, managers can accept, decline requests. They can see which employees have a request in the same period. 
The application will track the vacationdays you have left etc.

The application was build using the Object Oriented SOLID principle.

KEMBIT now uses the application. All the requests are now regulated by the appliction I built during my internship!
